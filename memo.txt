To-do...
 Revise vizPt_curve2d
   - Modify to work with "offset", in prep for 3D viz.
   - Revise markers.
   - Call effective vizPt_curve1d, to see distance from plane (vs s1, s2?)
   
 Revise vizPt_curve1d
   - Synchronize to 2D markers.
   - Modify legends and title to report vs space.
   - Mark "in space" pt based on distance to neighbor + interp.
 
 Revise vizPt_curve
   - Handle 3+D.
   
 Revise vizPtVs ~ studyPt.
   - Add "deltaRoot", "deltaSSRoot", "deltaNewton".
 
 > Refactor, comment...?
 > Write default vizPt script.
 > RM deprecated stuff.
