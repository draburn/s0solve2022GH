Or don't "README"; whatevs.
But, I've had issues with git pull from my AlienWare PC to a USB stick not working,
 and I'd like to see that my EPS/ICPP 2012 USB hasn't become afflicted.
To that end, I make this vacuous commit.
Or, perhaps more importantly:
 Current focus is study/20220326BeyondZero/0328ReturnToZero/,
 most actively zlinsolf195.m,
 but also particularly findLevPt_0527.m, zcompare.m, zlinsolf100.m, and findZero_800.m.
Enjoy.

Looks like it's not an issue with the EPS/ICPP USB.
Just an issue with "Leo", likely filesysetem,
